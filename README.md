### Supported Features At A Glance

Feature/Capability | Azure AI Service | Description
------------------ | ---------------- | -----------
**Shared Infrastructure Model** | All | The AI Application Gateway simplifies and streamlines the deployment of multiple AI Solutions by utilizing a shared infrastructure backbone. This approach allows for deploying the infrastructure once and subsequently scaling it to build and deploy numerous AI Chatbots/Applications.
**Enhanced AI Application Deployments** | All | The gateway is designed to be AI Application *Aware*, allowing Azure AI Service deployments to be configured individually for each AI Application. This approach simplifies the sharing of AI Service deployments across different AI Applications.
**Model Agnostic Endpoints** | - Azure AI Foundry Models<br>- Azure AI Agent Service | The gateway exposes each AI Application through a unified endpoint, hiding the underlying AI Service model deployment endpoints from client applications. As a result, model/agent deployment endpoints can be quickly updated without requiring any changes to client applications.
**Intelligent Traffic Routing** | - Azure AI Foundry Models<br>- Azure AI Agent Service | The gateway router provides the following features.<br>- **Circuit Breaker** Each AI Application can be configured with multiple backend endpoints, and the gateway acts as a circuit-breaker by automatically switching to the next prioritized endpoint when one is throttled (HTTP 429), while temporarily excluding throttled endpoints from traffic until they recover.<br>- **Rate Limiting** Users can define RPM limits per backend endpoint. The AI Gateway enforces rate limiting by returning HTTP 429 responses to prevent overloading of an endpoint and ensure fair utilization of model capacity.<br>- **Traffic Splitting** Router implementations include Priority based (default), Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Active Connections, Random Weighted and Latency Weighted<br>- **Health Check Policies** When enabled, the AI Gateway monitors backend endpoint latency and automatically disables an endpoint when the pre-configured response time threshold (in minutes) is exceeded.
**Streaming API Responses** | Azure AI Foundry Models (Chat Completions API only) | The AI Application Gateway fully supports the response *streaming* feature provided by Azure OpenAI Chat Completions API.  This function is seamlessly integrated with semantic caching, state management and traffic routing features.
**Semantic Caching** | Azure AI Foundry Models | This feature, integrated into the AI Application Gateway, caches OpenAI Service prompts and responses based on semantic similarity. It can improve runtime performance of LLM/AI applications by up to 40%, leveraging *PostgreSQL's* vectorization and semantic search capabilities.
**Conversational State Management** | Azure AI Foundry Models (Chat Completion API only) | AI Chatbots must maintain context during end user sessions so they can reference previous user inputs, ensuring coherent and contextually relevant conversations.  This feature manages conversational state, scaling to support 10 to hundreds of concurrent user sessions for multiple AI applications. It can operate independently or with *Semantic Caching* to enhance performance.
**Long-term Memory (Personalization)** | Azure AI Foundry Models (Chat Completion API only) | The AI Gateway supports long-term user memory, a feature that enables personalized interactions by continuously learning from user inputs over time. When enabled for an AI Application, the gateway extracts and stores relevant facts from user prompts such as preferences, context and behavioral patterns. It then uses this accumulated knowledge to tailor responses, maintain conversational continuity, and generate context-aware follow-up questions that reflect the userâ€™s history and intent.
**Message Persistence (Chat History)** | Azure AI Foundry Models | This feature allows persisting Azure OpenAI Service *Prompts* and *Completions* in a PostgreSQL database for introspection and quick troubleshooting of API requests.
**Secure by Design** | All | The API's exposed by the AI Application Gateway can be easily secured using Microsoft Entra ID (Default). This feature ensures only authenticated users or client applications are able to access the API endpoints. 
**Dynamic Server Configuration** | All | In standalone mode (**single instance**), the AI Gateway server exposes a separate reconfiguration (/reconfig) endpoint to enable rapid deployment and testing of backend endpoints.
**API Metrics Collection** | All | The Gateway continously collects backend API metrics and exposes them thru the metrics (/ metrics) endpoint.  Using this feature, users can analyze the throughput and latency metrics for each AI Application & optimize traffic routing.
**Observability and Traceability** | All | The AI Application Gateway uses the Azure Application Insights SDK to collect and send detailed telemetry on Azure OpenAI and dependent services to Azure Monitor.
**Client SDK's and AI Application (LLM) Frameworks** | Azure AI Foundry Models | The AI Application Gateway server supports [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/switching-endpoints) Client SDK.  The gateway has also been tested to work with [Prompt Flow](https://github.com/microsoft/promptflow) and [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/azure_openai/) LLM frameworks.
**Robust Runtime** | All | The AI Application Gateway, powered by the Node.js runtime and Chrome V8 engine, uses a single-threaded event loop for asynchronous request handling. It is highly performant and can scale to manage thousands of concurrent requests.

### Usage scenarios

The AI Application Gateway can be used in the following scenarios.
1. **Rapid deployment of AI Chatbots (or AI Information Assistants)**
   
   The AI Application Gateway solution provides core features such as *Semantic Caching*, *State Management*, *Traffic Routing* and *API Metrics Collection* right out of the box, which are crucial for implementing conversational AI applications such as AI Chatbots.

2. **Capturing Azure AI Service API usage metrics and estimating capacity for AI applications/workloads**

   For each AI Application, the gateway collects Azure AI Service endpoint usage metrics.  The metrics are collected for each AI application based on pre-configured time intervals. In the case of Azure OpenAI Service, the collected metrics include *Tokens per minute* (TPM) and *Requests per minute* (RPM). These metrics can then be used to estimate *Provisioned Throughput Units* for each OpenAI workload.

3. **Intelligently route AI Application requests to Azure AI Service deployments/backends**

   For each AI Application, the AI Application Gateway functions as an intelligent router and distributes AI Service API traffic among multiple backend endpoints.  The gateway keeps track of unavailable/busy backend endpoints and automatically redirects traffic to available endpoints thereby distributing the API traffic load evenly and not overloading a given endpoint with too many requests.  

   The gateway currently supports proxying requests to the following Azure AI Services.
     - Azure AI Foundry Models (Support for OpenAI models and models that support the *Azure AI Model Inference API*)
     - OpenAI Models
     - Azure AI Search (Full API support)
     - Azure AI Language (Limited API support - Entity Linking, Language detection, Key phrase extraction, NER, PII, Sentiment analysis and opinion mining only)
     - Azure AI Translator (Limited API support - Text Translation only)
     - Azure AI Content Safety (Limited API support - Analyze Text and Analyze Image only)

### Deployment Options
Deploy the AI Application Gateway in a pre-production environment first and configure the desired features by setting the configuration parameters to appropriate values. The pre-production environment should be as close as possible to an actual production environment. Rigorously test and validate the API routing, caching, state management, security and persistence features to confirm their optimal functionality as anticipated.

The Sections below describe the steps to configure and deploy the Gateway on Azure.  Although, there are multiple deployment options available on Azure, we will only describe the top two options recommended for production deployments.

**Recommended for Usage Scenarios 1 and 2**

- Containerize the Gateway and deploy it on a standalone *Virtual Machine*. Refer to Sections **A** and **B** below.

**Recommended for Usage Scenario 3**

1. Containerize the AI Application Gateway and deploy it on a serverless container platform such as *Azure Container Apps*.

   We will not be describing the steps for this option here.  Readers can follow the deployment instructions described in Azure Container Apps documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/tutorial-code-to-cloud?source=recommendations&tabs=bash%2Ccsharp&pivots=acr-remote).
2. Containerize the AI Application Gateway and deploy it on a container platform such as *Azure Kubernetes Service*. Refer to Sections **B** and **E** below.

### Important Notes

> Please review the sections below before proceeding to Section **A**.

**Gateway Router/Load Balancer**

It is important to understand how the Gateway's load balancer distributes incoming API requests among configured Azure OpenAI backends (model deployment endpoints). Please read below.

- The Gateway will strictly follow the priority order when forwarding OpenAI API requests to backends. Lower numeric values equate to higher priority. This implies, the gateway will forward requests to backends with priority of '0', '1' and then go in that order.  Priorities assigned to OpenAI backends can be viewed by invoking the *instanceinfo* endpoint - `/instanceinfo`. 
- When a backend endpoint is busy or throttled (returns http status code = 429), the gateway will mark this endpoint as unavailable and **record** the 'retry-after' seconds value returned in the OpenAI API response header.  The gateway will not forward/proxy any more API requests to this backend until retry-after seconds has elapsed thereby ensuring the backend (OpenAI endpoint) doesn't get overloaded with too many requests.
- When all configured backend endpoints are busy or throttled (return http status code = 429), the gateway will return the **lowest** 'retry-after' seconds value returned by one of the *throttled* OpenAI backends. This value (in seconds) will be returned in the Gateway response header 'retry-after'.  Client applications should ideally wait the no. of seconds returned in the 'retry-after' response header before making a subsequent API call.
- For as long as all the backend endpoints are busy/throttled, the Gateway will perform global rate limiting and continue to return the **lowest** 'retry-after' seconds in it's response header ('retry-after').

**Semantic Caching and Retrieval**

Cached completions are retrieved based on semantic text similarity algorithm and distance threshold configured for each AI Application.  Caching and retrieval of Azure OpenAI Service responses (completions) can be enabled at 3 levels. 

1. Global Setting

   To enable caching of OpenAI Service responses/completions, the environment variable *API_GATEWAY_USE_CACHE* must be set to "true".  If this variable is empty or not set, caching and retrieval of OpenAI Service completions (responses) will be disabled for all configured AI Applications.
2. AI Application

   To enable caching at AI Application level, the configuration attribute *cacheSettings.useCache* must be set to "true".  If this variable is empty or not set (or set to "false"), caching and retrieval of OpenAI Service completions (responses) will be disabled for the AI Application (only).
3. API Gateway (HTTP) Request

   Caching and retrieval of completions can be disabled for each individual API Gateway request by passing in a query parameter *use_cache* and setting its value to *false* (eg., `?use_cache=false`).  Setting this parameter value to "true" has no effect.

Prior to turning on *Semantic Caching* feature for an AI Application (in Production), please review the following notes.

- The semantic caching feature utilizes an Azure OpenAI *embedding* model to vectorize prompts.  Any of the three embedding models offered by Azure OpenAI Service can be used to vectorize/embedd prompt data.  The embedding models have a request token size limit of 8K and output dimension of 1536 tokens. This implies, any request payload containing more than 8K tokens (prompt) will likely be truncated and result in faulty search results.
- By default, *pgvector* extension performs exact nearest neighbor search which provides excellent recall. However, search performance is likely to take a hit (degrade) as the number of records in the table go above 1K. To trade some recall for query performance, its recommended to add an index and use approximate nearest neighbor search.  *pgvector* extension supports two index types - *HNSW* and *IVFFlat*.  Between the two, HNSW has better query performance. Refer to the snippet below to add an HNSW index to the *apigtwycache* table.  Use `psql` to add the index.
  ```bash
  # Create HNSW index for cosine similarity distance function.
  #
  => CREATE INDEX ON apigtwycache USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
  #
  # To use L2 distance, set the distance function to 'vector_l2_ops'. Similarly, for IP distance function use 'vector_ip_ops'.
  ```
- During functional tests, setting the cosine similarity score threshold to a higher value *> 0.95* was found to deliver more accurate search results. 
- The *Inner Product* distance function has not been thoroughly tested with sample data.  Prior to using this function, it is advised to run functional tests and verify results.

**Invalidating Cached Entries**

- When semantic caching and retrieval is enabled at the global level (*API_GATEWAY_USE_CACHE=true*), the Gateway periodically runs a cache entry invalidator process on a pre-configured schedule.  If no schedule is configured, the cache invalidator process is run on a default schedule every 45 minutes.  This default schedule can be overridden by setting the environment variable *API_GATEWAY_CACHE_INVAL_SCHEDULE* as described in Section **A** below.
- For each AI Application, cached entries can be invalidated (deleted) by setting the configuration attribute *cacheSettings.entryExpiry*. This attribute must be set to a value that conforms to PostgreSQL *Interval* data type. If this attribute value is empty or not set, cache entry invalidation will be skipped.  Refer to the documentation [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-INTERVAL-INPUT) to configure the cache invalidation interval to an appropriate value.

**Conversational State Management**

When interacting with AI Chatbots and information assistants, maintaining conversational continuity and context is crucial for generating accurate relevant responses to user's questions. Memory management for user sessions can be configured as follows.

1. Configure global setting

   To enable memory management at the API Gateway level, first set the environment variable *API_GATEWAY_STATE_MGMT* to "true".  If this env variable is empty or not set, memory (state) management will be disabled for all AI Applications.
2. Configure AI Application setting

   To enable memory management for an AI Application, the attribute *memorySettings.useMemory* must be set to "true" in the router configuration file.  If this attribute is empty or set to "false", memory management for user sessions will be disabled.

Prior to turning on *Conversational State Management* feature for an AI Application (in Production), please review the following notes.

- Conversational state management feature is only supported for Azure OpenAI Chat Completion API.
- When memory management is enabled for an AI application, the AI Application Gateway will return a custom http header `x-thread-id` in the API response.  This custom header will contain a unique value (GUID) representing a Thread ID.  To initiate a new user session and have the AI Application Gateway manage the conversational context, client applications must send this value in the http request header `x-thread-id`, in subsequent API calls.  The Thread ID represents an end user's session with an AI Chatbot/Assistant application.  A client application can end a user session at any time by not sending this custom http header in the API request.
- Use the *memorySettings.msgCount* attribute to specify the number of end user interactions (messages) to persist for each user session. Once the number of saved user interactions reaches this max. value (specified by this attribute), the memory manager component will discard the oldest message and only keep the most recent messages.  For each user session, the first user interaction (message) will always be retained by the memory manager.
- Use the *memorySettings.entryExpiry* attribute to specify the expiry time for user sessions.  After a user's session expires, API requests containing the expired Thread ID in the http header will receive an exception stating the session has expired.
- To quickly test the user session state management feature, you can use one of the provided standalone nodejs applications. See below.
  
  - A simple chat application that uses REST API calls - `./samples/chat-client/simple-chat-app.js`.
  - A chat application that uses Azure OpenAI SDK to make streaming API calls - `./samples/chat-client/stream-chat-app.js`

**Invalidating Memory Entries**

- When conversational state management feature is enabled at the global level (*API_GATEWAY_STATE_MGMT=true*), the AI Application Gateway periodically runs a memory invalidator process on a pre-configured Cron schedule.  If no schedule is configured, the memory invalidator process is run on a default schedule every 10 minutes.  This default schedule can be overridden by setting the environment variable *API_GATEWAY_MEMORY_INVAL_SCHEDULE* as described in Section **A** below.
- For each AI Application, memory entries can be invalidated (deleted) by setting the configuration attribute *memorySettings.entryExpiry*. This attribute must be set to a value that conforms to PostgreSQL *Interval* data type. If this attribute value is empty or not set, memory entry invalidation will be skipped.  Refer to the documentation [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-INTERVAL-INPUT) to configure memory entry invalidation interval to an appropriate value.

**Persisting Prompts and Completions**

- When global environment variable *API_GATEWAY_PERSIST_PROMPTS* is set to *true*, prompts and completions along with other API request related metadata will be persisted in database table *apigtwyprompts*.
- API Request *prompts* will not be persisted under the following conditions a) All backend endpoints for a given AI Application are busy/throttled.  In this case, the Gateway will return HTTP status code 429. b) API Gateway encounters an internal error while handling a request.  In this case, the Gateway will return HTTP status code 500.
- The Gateway returns a unique (GUID) id *x-request-id* in the HTTP response header for every request.  This header value along with the *user* value sent in the API request (body) can be used to query table *apigtwyprompts* and troubleshoot issues.  For instance, these values could be used to query a request that failed due to application of a content filter (HTTP status = 400).

The remainder of this readme describes how to configure/enable specific features and deploy the AI Application Gateway on Azure.

### A. Configure and run the AI Application Gateway on a standalone *Virtual Machine*

Before we can get started, you will need a Linux Virtual Machine to run the AI Application Gateway. If you haven't already, provision a Virtual Machine with a Linux flavor of your choice on Azure.

1. Clone or fork this GitHub repository into a directory on the VM.

   SSH login to the Virtual Machine using a terminal window. If you intend to customize the Gateway components, it's best to fork this repository into your GitHub account and then clone the repository to the VM.

2. Install Node.js.

   Refer to the installation instructions on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for your specific Linux distribution.

3. Install PostgreSQL database server.

   > **NOTE**:
   > If you do not intend to use *Semantic Caching*, *Conversational State Management*, *Long-term User Memory* or *Message Persistence* features, you can safely skip this step and go to Step 4.

   Refer to the installation instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/quickstart-create-server-portal) to install *Azure Database for PostgreSQL*.  Create a new database and give it a suitable name.  Note down the database name, server user name and password.  Save it in a secure location as we will need this info. in a subsequent step (below).

   You can connect to the database using any one of the following options - 1) [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/quickstart-create-server-cli) 2) [psql or Azure Cloud shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/quickstart-create-server-portal).

   After making the changes, save the `./api-router-config.json` file.

   **IMPORTANT**:

   **Azure AI Foundry Models**:

   When no backend endpoint router type is specified for an AI Application, the default **Priority** based router will be used.  For priority based endpoint routing, the model/agent deployment endpoints/URI's should be listed in increasing order of priority (top down). Endpoints listed at the top of the list will be assigned higher priority than those listed at the lower levels.  For each API Application, the Gateway server will traverse and load the deployment URI's starting at the top in order of priority. While routing requests to OpenAI API backends, the gateway will strictly follow the priority order and route requests to endpoints with higher priority first before falling back to low priority endpoints. 

5. Set the gateway server environment variables.

   Set the environment variables to the correct values and export them before proceeding to the next step. Refer to the table below for descriptions of the environment variables.

   Leave the terminal window open.

7. Retrieve the AI Application Gateway Instance info (/instanceinfo)

   Use a web browser to access the AI Application Gateway *info* endpoint - `/instanceinfo`. Specify correct values for the gateway listen port and environment. See below.

   http://localhost:{API_GATEWAY_PORT}/api/v1/{API_GATEWAY_ENV}/apirouter/instanceinfo

8. Access the AI Application Gateway load balancer/router (/lb) endpoint

   Use **Curl** or **Postman** to send a few completion / chat completion API requests to the gateway server *load balancer* endpoint - `/lb`.  Remember to substitute the correct value for *AI_APPLICATION_ID* in the URL below.  The AI Application ID value should be one of the unique *appId* values specified in Gateway configuration file `./api-router-config.json`.

   http://localhost:{API_GATEWAY_PORT}/api/v1/{API_GATEWAY_ENV}/apirouter/lb/{AI_APPLICATION_ID}

   Review the OpenAI API response and log lines output by the gateway server in the respective terminal windows.

**IMPORTANT**:

- For invoking the model deployment endpoints exposed by AI Application Gateway from a ***LangChain*** LLM application (/framework), two environment variables must be set. See below.
  - _AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_PATH_: Set the value of this variable to the Gateway load balancer / router endpoint URI (/lb). This URI can also be specified as part of the OpenAI configuration object (in code).
  - _AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME_: Set the value of this variable to the *AI Application* name/ID configured in the Gateway. This value can also be specified as part of the OpenAI configuration object (in code).

  Refer to the sample script provided in `./samples/lang-chain` directory for details.

- For generating OpenAI API traffic and/or simulating API workload, one of the following methods can be used.  See below.
  - Update and use the provided shell script `./tests/test-oai-api-gateway.sh` with sample data.  For an AI Application, observe how the Gateway intelligently distributes the OpenAI API requests among multiple configured backend endpoints.
  - For simulating continuous API traffic and performing comprehensive load testing (capacity planning), use *Azure Load Testing* PaaS service.

### B. Containerize the AI Application Gateway and deploy it on the Virtual Machine

Before getting started with this section, make sure you have installed a container runtime such as `docker` or `containerd` on the Linux VM. For installing docker engine, refer to the docs [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

1. Build the AI Application Gateway container image.

   Review the container image build script `./Dockerfile`.  Make any required updates to the environment variables.  The environment variables can also be passed to the docker engine at build time.  To do this, you can modify the provided container build script `./scripts/build-container.sh`.  After making the updates to this build shell script, run the script to build the Gateway container image.  See command snippet below.

   ```bash
   # Run the container image build
   $ . ./scripts/build-container.sh
   #
   # List the container images.  This command should list the images on the system.
   $ docker images
   #
   ```

2. Run the containerized AI Application Gateway server instance.

   Run the Gateway container instance using the provided `./scripts/start-container.sh` shell script.  Refer to the command snippet below.

   ```bash
   # Run the AI Application Gateway container instance
   $ . ./scripts/start-container.sh
   #
   # Leave this terminal window open
   ```

3. Access the Gateway server load balancer/router (/lb) endpoint

   Use **Curl** or **Postman** to send a few completion / chat completion API requests to the gateway server *load balancer* endpoint - `/lb`.  See URL below.

   http://localhost:{API_GATEWAY_PORT}/api/v1/{API_GATEWAY_ENV}/apirouter/lb/{AI_APPLICATION_ID}

   Review the OpenAI API response and log lines output by the gateway server in the respective terminal windows.

   > **TIP**:
   > You can update and use the shell script `./tests/test-oai-api-gateway.sh` with sample data to test how the Gateway intelligently distributes the OpenAI API requests among multiple configured backend endpoints.

### C. Analyze Azure AI Service API traffic metrics

1. Access the AI Application Gateway metrics endpoint and analyze Azure AI Service API metrics.

   Use a web browser and access the Gateway *metrics* endpoint to retrieve the backend API metrics information.  The metrics endpoint URL - `/metrics`, is listed below.

   http://localhost:{API_GATEWAY_PORT}/api/v1/{API_GATEWAY_ENV}/apirouter/metrics

   Azure AI Service endpoint metrics collected by the Gateway server across all AI Applications is described in the table below.

   Metric name | Description

   ![alt tag](./images/api-gateway-telemetry-05.png)

### D. Reconfigure the AI Application Gateway

In standalone mode (single instance), the AI Application Gateway configuration can be updated using one of the two options described below. In both cases, the AI Application Gateway server must be running. 

1. Reconfigure the AI Application Gateway using the `/reconfig` API endpoint.
   - Update the AI Application Gateway resoures.
     Open the AI Gateway configuration file (`api-router-config.json`) and update configurations for AI Applications as needed.  Save this file
   - Reload the AI Application Gateway configuration.
     Use **Curl** command in a terminal window or a web browser to access the gateway *reconfiguration* endpoint - `/reconfig`.  See URL below.The **private key** of the Gateway is required to reload the gateway configuration.

     http://{API_GATEWAY_HOST}:{API_GATEWAY_PORT}/api/v1/{API_GATEWAY_ENV}/apirouter/reconfig/{API_GATEWAY_KEY}
2. Use the AI Application Gateway *control plane* (`/cp`) API endpoint.
   - Use `curl` or any other HTTP client to update AI Application Gateway resources.  The control plane API endpoint is listed below. Substitute correct values for AI resource types and names.  Refer to the table below.

     **AI Application Gateway Control Plane API**

     http://{API_GATEWAY_HOST}:{API_GATEWAY_PORT}/api/v1/{API_GATEWAY_ENV}/apirouter/cp/{AI_RESOURCE_TYPE}/{AI_RESOURCE_NAME}/{ACTION}

     Gateway Resource Type | Action(s)/HTTP Method | Description |
     --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
     **AiAppServer** (AI Application Gateway/Server) | **operations/GET**<br>**get/GET**<br>**deploy/POST** | **operations**: Returns *Operations* supported by AI Application Gateway resource. This endpoint also returns the JSON schema of all gateway resource types.<br>**get**: Returns the AI Application Gateway resource configuration(s).<br>**deploy**: Deploys a new *AI Application Gateway* configuration.  CAUTION: This operation will result in deleting the existing gateway configuration & deploying a new set of AI Application resources.
     **AiApplication** (AI Application) | **operations/GET**<br>**get/GET**<br>**deploy/POST**<br>**delete/DELETE** | **operations**: Returns *Operations* supported by an AI Application resource. This endpoint also returns the JSON schema of an AI Application resource.<br>**get**: Returns the AI Application resource (definition).<br>**deploy**: Deploys a new or updates an existing *AI Application* resource.<br>**delete**: Deletes an existing AI Application resource.

**IMPORTANT**:

- A side effect of reconfiguring the Gateway is that all current and historical endpoint metric values collected and cached by the server will be reset. Hence, if you want to retain endpoint metrics history, you should save the metrics (/metrics) output prior to reloading the updated configuration file.
- It is advised to reconfigure the gateway during a maintenance time window (down time) when there is minimal to no API traffic.  Reconfiguring the entire AI Application Gateway configuration when it is actively serving AI Application requests may result in undefined behavior.

### E. Deploy the AI Application Gateway on *Azure Kubernetes Service*

Before proceeding with this section, make sure you have installed the following services on Azure.
- An *Azure Container Registry* (ACR) instance
- An *Azure Kubernetes Cluster* (AKS) instance

The following command line tools should be installed on the Linux VM.
- Azure CLI (`az`)
- Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`)
- Helm CLI (`helm`)

Additionally, the following resources should be deployed/configured.

- A Kubernetes ingress controller (**Ngnix**) should be deployed and running on the AKS / Kubernetes cluster.
- The AKS cluster should be attached to the ACR instance.  The cluster's managed identity should have *ACR Pull* permissions so cluster nodes can pull container images from the attached ACR.

1. Push the AI Application Gateway container image into ACR.

   Refer the script snippet below to push the Gateway container image into ACR.  Remember to substitute ACR name with the name of your container registry.

   ```bash
   # Login to the ACR instance. Substitute the correct name of your ACR instance.
   $ az acr login --name [acr-name].azurecr.io
   #
   # Tag the container image so we can push it to ACR repo.
   $ docker tag az-ais-api-gateway [acr-name].azurecr.io/az-ais-api-gateway:v1.9.0.062824
   # 
   # List container images on your VM
   $ docker images
   #
   # Push the AI Application Gateway container image to ACR repo.
   $ docker push [acr-name].azurecr.io/az-ais-api-gateway:v1.9.0.062824
   #
   ```

   Use Azure portal to verify the Gateway container image was stored in the respective repository (`az-oai-api-gateway`).

2. Deploy the Azure OpenAI API endpoints configuration.

   Create a Kubernetes *ConfigMap* resource containing the Gateway endpoint configurations.  See command snippet below.

   Get the public IP of Nginx ingress controller (application routing system).  Refer to the command snippet below.

   ```bash
   # Get public IP (Azure LB IP) assigned to Nginx ingress controller service. Save (copy) the IP address listed under
   # column 'EXTERNAL-IP' in the command output. See below.
   #
   $ kubectl get svc -n app-routing-system
   NAME    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                                      AGE
   nginx   LoadBalancer   10.0.114.112   xx.xx.xx.xx   80:30553/TCP,443:32318/TCP,10254:31744/TCP   2d
   ```

   Use a web browser to access the Gateway Server *instance information* endpoint (/instanceinfo). Substitute the public IP of the Nginx ingress controller which you copied in the previous step.  See below.

   http://{NGINX_PUBLIC_IP}/api/v1/{API_GATEWAY_ENV}/apirouter/instanceinfo

   Use **Curl** or **Postman** to send a few completion / chat completion API requests to the gateway server *load balancer* endpoint - `/lb`.  See URL below.

   http://{NGINX_PUBLIC_IP}/api/v1/{API_GATEWAY_ENV}/apirouter/lb/{AI_APPLICATION_ID}

   **IMPORTANT**:

   To deploy the AI Chat Application and allow end users to interact with generative AI applications, refer to the instructions in [frontend/Readme](./frontend/README.md) doc.

   **Congratulations!**
